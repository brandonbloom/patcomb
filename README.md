# patcomb

Interpreter and (naive) compiler for non-linear pattern matching in Clojure.

## Usage

Don't.

## Notes

This name is short for "pattern combinators", but that's actually a misnomer.
Originally, I was experimenting with functional combinators, but quickly
remembered why I dislike combinator libraries: they couple representation with
evaluation. Instead, this design has a symbolic representation of patterns.
